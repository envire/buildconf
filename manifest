# Ignoring packages: same principle than package exclusion, but this time the
# packages are considered to be installed and up-to-date. This is useful if you
# want to use an already installed software package.
#
# For instance, let's assume the orocos/rtt is already installed on your
# machine. You would then simply do:
#
# ignored_packages:
#   - rtt
